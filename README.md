# WeatherConditions

A simple MVVM app, where a user can add and see result of WeatherConditions.
A WeatherCondition, in this context, is simply some condition that can be true depending on the weather.

For example, user could create a WeatherCondition which will become true if the air temperature is bigger than 20 degrees.

It's a simple and fun way to check the weather forcast!

Future updates may include:

- Being able to base weather conditions on historic data, 
------ such as: "Will it be warmer than the average air temperature of last 7 days?"

- Being able to group conditions, and see if all of them are true. 
------ If the user likes fishing, it could create a group of conditions like 
------ "Is it warmer than 20 degrees? and 
------ "Is it less than 5 m/s wind strenght?", 
------ and see if today is a good day for fishing
